# Authorization Assignment
This is a small assignment to demonstrate how to do authentication using JWTs.  
See assignment description here: [Secure Software](https://rpede.github.io/SecureSoftwareDevelopment/assignments/authorization)

## Instructions for testing functionality
Run the project and either use the built in Swagger tool in Development mode, or use an external tool to run a POST request at `/login`.
This will yield a JWT bearer token which is needed to access and execute API endpoints.

Credentials are:
|Username|Password|
|---|---|
|EditorUser|EditorPassword|
|JournalistUser|JournalistPassword|
|RegisteredUser|RegisteredPassword|

POST `/login` JSON Format:
```
{
  "username": "JournalistUser",
  "password": "JournalistPassword"
}
```
POST `/createComment` (Roles: Registered) JSON Format:
```
{
  "content": "Text goes here"
}
```
POST `/createArticle` (Roles: Journalist) JSON Format:
```
{
  "title": "Text goes here",
  "content": "Text goes here"
}
```
PUT `/editArticle` (Roles: Journalist, Editor) JSON Format:
```
{
  "articleId": 1,
  "title": "Text goes here",
  "content": "Text goes here"
}
```
PUT `/editComment` (Roles: Editor) JSON Format:
```
{
  "commentId": 1,
  "content": "Text goes here"
}
```
DELETE `/deleteArticle?articleId=1` (Roles: Editor)  
DELETE `/deleteComment?commentId=1` (Roles: Editor)  

GET `/getRole` (Roles: Anonymous)  
GET `/getArticle?articleId=1` (Roles: Anonymous)

All routes can be found in the ![RoutesController.cs](SampleApp/BackEnd/RoutesController.cs) file.

Note: The `DatabaseSeed.sql` script is run at startup, if the file `Database.db` does not exist.
